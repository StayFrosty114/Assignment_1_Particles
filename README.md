# Assignment_1_Particles
Advanced Scripting assignment 1: Making a spellbook using particle systems and scriptable objects.
I feel I should mention the particle asset pack in my project folder.
None of the prefabs were used, I only wanted some textures that came with it.
Pls don't accuse me of the big bad plagiarism.
